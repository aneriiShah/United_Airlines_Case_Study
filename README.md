Mansourian Insurance is a growing private healthcare insurance provider. The company was founded on the premise that advanced analytics can improve the health insurance industry.   

Every year, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) conducts surveys to understand the latest demographic, health, and fitness trends. 

You have been tasked with analyzing the 2014 published survey results for 3 states and provide your recommendations back to the managerial team.

**Questions:**

How does health status, represented by average number of days with bad physical health in the past month (PHYSHLTH), differ by state?  Provide an indication of distribution using whatever statistics or charts you find suitable. 

How do you know if the above difference between states is statistically significant? 

Digging deeper into the data, what are the top predictor variables impacting health (i.e. demographics, behaviors, previous illness, etc.)?

If you had additional time, what other types of data mining techniques and / or analytical modeling would you explore with this dataset?
